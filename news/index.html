        <h4>Civic education is an American issue—not a partisan one</h4>
        <byline>Randell Trammell | 03/04/2021</byline>
        <p>Americans’ participation in civic life is essential to sustaining our democratic form of government. Without it, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people will not last. Of increasing concern to many is the declining levels of civic engagement across the country.</p>

        <h4>Our democracy is ailing. Civics education has to be part of the cure.</h4>
        <byline>Danielle Allen and Paul Carrese | 03/02/2021</byline>
        <p>Our constitutional democracy is ailing. If we didn’t know that before Jan. 6, the lesson was etched into our souls that day. And one major reason for our trouble is that for several generations we have failed to provide civic education in our K-12 schools.</p>

          <h4>America Needs History and Civics Education to Promote Unity</h4>
          <byline>Six former U.S. education secretaries | 03/01/2021</byline>
          <p>Following years of polarization and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the world’s oldest constitutional democracy is in grave danger. We stand at a crossroads, called to protect this democracy and to work toward unity. Current and future generations will look back to examine how we chose to act, and why. A key part of our task is to reinvigorate teaching and learning of American history and civics in our nation’s schools.</p>
