    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What is civic education?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Civic education is a class or curriculum for students that provides them with a robust and engaging understanding of US government and politics. Today, many students are given lacking or biased civic education in schools, and some don't have it at all.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why do we need civic education?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>The United States needs robust civic education to restore confidence in our democracy and our elections, to increase civic engagement, to inform eligible voters on how, when, and where they can vote, and to improve the turnout of young voters on Election Day.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How can civic education be nonpartisan?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>By crafting curricula through bipartisan collaboration, legislators, school board members, superintendents, and educators can work together to create a fair and unbiased set of standards that educators can be proud to teach.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How can civic education help our students?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Robust civic education will engage students and encourage them to participate in elections once they're eligible. Since young voters tend to be the lowest-turnout age group, education of students is crucial to encouraging them to vote.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How can civic education help our democracy?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>By increasing civic engagement and restoring trust in our democracy, civic education can help prevent future outcomes like the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. In addition, robust civic education standards will engage and inform young people on how to form their own beliefs, allowing them to have an active voice in government.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How can these goals be achieved?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Two Congressional Acts, the For the People Act of 2021, and the Educating for Democracy Act of 2020, aim to strengthen American democracy and educate students and eligible voters about voting and civic engagement. These Acts, if passed, will establish new ways and means to educate citizens about their power and responsibility in affecting government work through voting.</p>
